# react/jsx-uses-react

📝 Disallow React to be incorrectly marked as unused.

💼🚫 This rule is enabled in the ☑️ `recommended` [config](https://github.com/ternaus/eslint-plugin-react#configs). This rule is _disabled_ in the 🏃 `jsx-runtime` [config](https://github.com/ternaus/eslint-plugin-react#configs).

<!-- end auto-generated rule header -->

JSX expands to a call to `React.createElement`, a file which includes `React`
but only uses JSX should consider the `React` variable as used.

If you are using the @jsx pragma this rule will mark the designated variable and not the `React` one.

This rule has no effect if the `no-unused-vars` rule is not enabled.

You can use the [shared settings](/README.md#configuration) to specify a custom pragma.

## Rule Details

Examples of **incorrect** code for this rule:

```js
var React = require('react');

// nothing to do with React
```

```jsx
/** @jsx Foo */
var React = require('react');

var Hello = <div>Hello {this.props.name}</div>;
```

Examples of **correct** code for this rule:

```jsx
var React = require('react');

var Hello = <div>Hello {this.props.name}</div>;
```

```jsx
/** @jsx Foo */
var Foo = require('foo');

var Hello = <div>Hello {this.props.name}</div>;
```

## When Not To Use It

If you are not using JSX, if React is declared as global variable, or if you do not use the `no-unused-vars` rule.

If you use the [automatic JSX runtime](https://react.dev/learn/writing-markup-with-jsx#the-jsx-compiler), add `react.configs.flat['jsx-runtime']` after the recommended config in `eslint.config.js`.

**Note**: When React >= 19.0.0 is detected, this rule is automatically disabled, since the automatic JSX transform is mandatory in React 19.
